						<h2>Myer-Briggs Test</h2>

						<p>Fairly accurate representation of who Adrian is as a person. His results indicated that although he is extraverted he also holds a lot of introversion with a 53%/47% split respectively. Adrian is approachable, enthusiastic and observant, not missing details that others may. Although he is fantastic at motivating others he may struggle to remain motivated himself without someone with a more practical hands on approach to projects (INFJ or INTJ). A good addition to any team as he can adapt easily and work well with anyone in the right circumstances
</p>
						<h2>Learning Style Test</h2>

						<p>As a reflector, Adrian tends to observe and analyse, providing feedback on what is happening in group environments. He will generally take a back seat approach and use the information gained through observation to maintain a big picture perspective.
</p>
						<h2>Leadership Style Quiz</h2>

						<h1>Project Idea</h1>
					</div>
					<div class="section content">
						<p>A mobile app that creates and collates a database of collector items (eg: trading cards, pop vinyls etc) with the ability to add friends and view their collections. If, for example, you are searching for a particular collectors item you can search your friends collections to see if they own it, if they do you can request a trade, rather than having to rely on them to see if they own it. <br><br>
						The service would provide an intuitive and user friendly display with different types of collections, for example pokemon cards, magic the gathering cards, pop vinyls etc. The databases for these types of collections already exist so finding the information would not be difficult to do, but users would need to manually input their collections. This would be a potential drawback as these types of collections can be rather large scale and may put users off from inputting the data to catalogue. A way around this could be to utilise a “leveling” system (because everyone loves leveling up). Adding the ability to add friends and view their collections would be beneficial in all respects when it comes to providing and retrieving information from peers. It would be easy to track your collection and track your friends collections by utilising a search option for ease of access to information, for example if you are searching for a particular item for your own collection and you search for it across your friends list you will be able to see who owns it, who owns multiples and would be open to a trade. In addition to this you will be able to form a list of items you will be willing to trade as well as viewing what your friends are willing to trade. Images of the items on the database is crucial to adding aesthetic value to the mobile app. With the images being readily available an image recognition service can be utilised to easily add the physical items to your digital collection by using the inbuilt camera to scan the physical image and match it to the digital image. In the case of pop vinyls, the same ideas can be applied but can also work in conjunction with funko to provide QR Codes enclosed with each pop vinyl to be easily added to the digital collection. The basic idea is to connect and share your physical collections digitally with friends and peers.
						<br>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Using .NET frameworks and SQL servers to create the databases</li>
							<li>Angular in conjunction with JavaScript for front end</li> 
							<li>Data server to store user information and cloud services to store users collection information for ease of access</li>
							<li>Highly feasible to acquire the skills, hardware and software to develop almost immediately</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						The success of the project would make collectors more enthusiastic about their collections and provide a sense of value to their collections as friends and peers can connect with each other and open more dialogue in regards to recent acquisitions of items. In future this could be extended to convention settings where collectors will be around each other and form new friendships.
