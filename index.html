						<h2>Myer-Briggs Test</h2>
							<div id="myerbriggs">

							</div>
						<p>Fairly accurate representation of who Adrian is as a person. His results indicated that although he is extraverted he also holds a lot of introversion with a 53%/47% split respectively. Adrian is approachable, enthusiastic and observant, not missing details that others may. Although he is fantastic at motivating others he may struggle to remain motivated himself without someone with a more practical hands on approach to projects (INFJ or INTJ). A good addition to any team as he can adapt easily and work well with anyone in the right circumstances
</p>
						<h2>Learning Style Test</h2>
							<div id="learningstyle">
							<img src="learning.png">
							</div>
						<p>As a reflector, Adrian tends to observe and analyse, providing feedback on what is happening in group environments. He will generally take a back seat approach and use the information gained through observation to maintain a big picture perspective.
</p>
						<h2>Leadership Style Quiz</h2>
							<div id="leadership">
							<img src="leadership.png">
							</div>
						<p>Adrian is efficient at empowering others to get the best results out of people. This is a skill gained from emotional intelligence and the ability to empathise with others. Adrian tends to be hands-on with interacting with others in a leadership position. Honesty, integrity and motivation are values Adrian thrives on.</p>
