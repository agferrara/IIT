I know, it's not the greatest thing in the world.
Considering I have had to work 120 hours in the last two weeks.
We laid off basically all of our casual staff at work leaving only 3 people to run the retail store I'm working at.
This has completely drained all energy from me and has left me with miniscule amounts of time to complete this.
I submitted something which is better than nothing at all.
Please take my mental and physical health into consideration when viewing my assessment.
I'm so tired.
